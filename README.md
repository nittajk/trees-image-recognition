# Tree species image classifier

This project is a deep learning image recognition system for classifying tree species using transfer learning with a ResNet18 model. The project was completed as part of a school course focused on machine learning and image processing.

## Overview

The goal was to build a machine learning model that can recognize different tree species based on image data. We collected our own dataset of tree images and fine-tuned a pre-trained ResNet18 model using PyTorch.
